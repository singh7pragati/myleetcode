easy
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n == 0 || n == 1)return n;
        int a = 2; 
        int b = 1;

        for(int i = 3; i<=n; i++){
            a = a + b;
            b = a - b;
        }

        return a;
    }
};
